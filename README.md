# Calculator

This project is part of the Free Code Camp's front-end track. I'll build a calculator using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The calculator should satisfy the following user stories:

- I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

- I can clear the input field with a clear button.

- I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
